# Library-Management-System-DSA-
Designed and implemented a console-based Library Management System using C and doubly circular linked lists. The system supports core operations such as inserting, deleting, displaying, and searching books by title. Implemented file handling for data persistence, allowing book data to be saved and updated across sessions.
